# Linking neuroimaging markers with genetics of psychiatric disorders in dHCP babies

# Objectives:

Increasing lines of evidence suggest deviations from the normal early developmental trajectory could give rise to a spectrum of psychiatric disorders, ranging from autism spectrum disorders in the early life to schizophrenia during adolescence and young adulthood. On the other hand, the heterogenous manifestation of behavioural symptoms of such diseases gives rise to difficulty in identifiying any real effect. To this end, by forming well-designed hypotheses and examining in individuals with minimal environmental impact such as infants, one may identify informed endophenotypes that provide novel insight into the underlying biological underpinnings of the diseases.
